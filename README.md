# Underwater imagenes reconstruction 

This proyect was made with the objetive of reconstructing the images received by an underwater drone pilot using generative adversarial networks.

The input images has not a very clear visibility because of the scattering effect of the water and the water turbidity. They have very low resolucion (300 x 170), thats because the umbilical wide that conects the drone with the pilot has a very low band width. For thease reasons, I use GANs to reconstructing the input images and improve its visibility and resolution.
